 abstract = {The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.},

abstract = {Abstract Neural networks have received considerable attention recently, mostly by non-statisticians. They are considered by many to be very promising tools for classification and prediction. In this paper we present an approach to modelling censored survival data using the input—output relationship associated with a simple feed-forward neural network as the basis for a non-linear proportional hazards model. This approach can be extended to other models used with censored survival data. The proportional hazards neural network parameters are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood. These maximum likelihood based models can be compared, using readily available techniques such as the likelihood ratio test and the Akaike criterion. The neural network models are illustrated using data on the survival of men with prostatic carcinoma. A method of interpreting the neural network predictions based on the factorial contrasts is presented.},

As an example, the method is applied to the use of the treadmill exercise test in evaluating the prognosis of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The treadmill test is shown to provide surprisingly little prognostic information beyond that obtained from basic clinical measurements.(JAMA 1982;247:2543-2546)}",
